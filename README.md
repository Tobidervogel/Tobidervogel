## Hey


**I'm Tobi, or Tobidervogel. I live in Germany and have been coding since 2023. I started with HTML and CSS and learned Python this year.**  

**In my free time, I code, draw, create Blender models and animations, and make videos and photos.**  

**It all started when I wanted to make a website for Christmas and design one for my mom. At first, I used Wix.com, but since I had to pay for storage, I tried coding with a simple old domain instead.**

**After that, I took a break from coding.**

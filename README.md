## Hey

**I'm Tobi, or Tobidervogel. I live in Germany and have been coding since 2021. I started with HTML and CSS, and I learned Python this year.**

**In my free time, I enjoy coding, drawing, creating Blender models and animations, and making videos and photos.**

**It all started when I was 11 and wanted to make a Christmas website and design one for my mom. At first, I used Wix.com, but since I had to pay for storage, I switched to coding using an old, simple domain instead.**          **[Link here](https://www.jacob-familie.de/survivalmom)**

**After that, I took a break from coding.**

**Later, I started coding again (HTML and CSS) and built some cool websites.**

**Then I learned Python, video and photo editing, and Blender – which is a language of its own, as huge and complex as it is.**

**And now – here I am.**
